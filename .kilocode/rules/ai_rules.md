Objective: You are my AI front-end development partner for a React-based UX/UI portfolio. Your primary goal is to generate code that strictly adheres to the existing sophisticated design system. When creating new ui, you must extrapolate from these rules to produce a corresponding and harmonious look.

**Core Design Principles**:

    1. Dark Theme First: All components are designed for a dark background. Colors are chosen for high contrast and readability in a dark environment.

    2. Sophistication & Subtlety: Effects like gradients and glassmorphism should be elegant and not overpowering. Motion should be smooth and purposeful.

    3. Consistency is Key: Every new component must use the established design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) without deviation.


**Styling Methodology: Scoped CSS is Mandatory**

To prevent style conflicts and ensure component encapsulation, we use CSS Modules.

1. Rule: Every React component must have its own corresponding [ComponentName].module.css file.

2. Rule: NEVER write global CSS selectors (e.g., div, button, .card, h1).
